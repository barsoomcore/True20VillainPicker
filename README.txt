This file is a very simple JavaScript/HTML page that provides the ability to select and dynamically update True20 Villain Roles, as defined by the gang on the True20 Forums.

You need JQuery to run this page -- just download it from JQuery.org and stick the jquery.js file in the same directory as the villainpicker.html.

villainpicker.html requires you to supply it with data in order for it to work. The existing page has the data for the "Artillery" already added but if you want to use this for all roles you'll need to supply the data dynamically. The files ending in ".data" include the required data for each role. You'll also want to set the "name" variable dynamically, I bet.

The DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND implementation of this also provides static links to each level of each role but that was built out of the Django back-end on the DPoNI site, so we've left that to the reader's imagination. You can just peek at our code to see how we did it.

Much thanks to The Shadow, Baduin, iwatt and ValhallaGH for actually doing most of the creative work here.
